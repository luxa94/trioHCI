  <hr>
  <p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On this dialog you can see form for adding new type to list of previously entered ones. 
  </br></br>
  Text fields you need to fill are:
  <ul>
  <li>"Id" for your tag, which must be unique for each tag. Tthis is the only time you can enter it, so be careful not to make mistake.
  <li>"Name" for your tag.
  <li>"Desctiption" for your tag.
  </ul>
  You can also browse picture for your type from file system by pressing on button "Browse". You must choose the specific picture for new type because premises of that type, which does not have their
  own picture, will inherit it from its type by default. 
  </br></br> 
  Click on button "Save" is saving your new type to the list, unlike the click on button "Cancel", which turns you on previous conditions without saving.
